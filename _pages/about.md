Hey, my name's **Matt**. I'm a **Software Engineer**, **Musician**, **Drummer**, **Travel Addict**, **Investor**, **Gamer**, **PC Enthusiast** and overall _nerd_ in general... currently living in Norfolk in the United Kingdom, where I also grew up.

I started my career as a **Front-End Web Developer**, then moved into a **Full-Stack Software Developer** role and finally to my current position of **Senior Software Engineer** over the past _5 years_. However, I've had an interest in anything computers and tech for as long as I can remember.

My current professional _stack_ revolves around everything **C# / .NET** including Web **API**s, **Razor** Pages, **Blazor** SPA applications and Microsoft **SQL** Server.

However, I'm very passionate about continued learning during my free time in a personal capacity and have an interest in expanding my knowledge and skillset in **OAuth2.0**, **OpenID Connect  (OIDC)**, **Go**, **Redis**, **GraphQL** and **NoSQL** just to name a few.

In the evenings and at the weekends I'm probably working on personal projects, trying to build up a portfolio of different applications, utilizing different technologies and techniques so that knowledge can be pulled from during my day job. Be sure to check back here as I update the site with completed projects or [Blog](/blog/) posts. Head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/melittleman) to check out my portfolio!

When I'm not staring at a screen, you'll likely find me playing drums, reading a self-improvement book, jamming with friends or bandmates, travelling and visiting new places or researching and studying up on new financial investment opportunities.

<!-- Finish writing more about band, touring etc... -->
