Hey, my name's **Matt**. I'm a **Software Engineer**, **Musician**, **Drummer**, **Travel Addict**, **Investor**, **Gamer**, **PC Enthusiast** and overall _nerd_ in general... currently living in Norfolk in the United Kingdom, where I also grew up.

## Software Engineer

I started my career as a **Front-End Web Developer**, then moved into a **Full-Stack Software Developer** role and finally to my current position of **Senior Software Engineer** over the past _5 years_. However, I've had an interest in anything computers and tech for as long as I can remember.

My current professional _stack_ revolves around everything **C# / .NET** including Web **API**s, **Razor** Pages, **Blazor** SPA applications and Microsoft **SQL** Server.

However, I'm very passionate about continued learning during my free time in a personal capacity and have an interest in expanding my knowledge and skillset in [OAuth2.0](https://oauth.net/2/){:target="_blank"}, [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/){:target="_blank"} **(OIDC)**, [Go](https://go.dev){:target="_blank"}, [Redis](https://redis.io){:target="_blank"}, **GraphQL** and **NoSQL** just to name a few.

In the evenings and at the weekends I'm probably working on personal projects, trying to build up a portfolio of different applications, utilizing different technologies and techniques so that knowledge can be pulled from during my day job. Be sure to check back here as I update the site with completed projects or [Blog](/blog/) posts. Head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/melittleman) to check out my portfolio!

## Drummer

Despite learning to play drums almost _15 years_ ago (yeah, I know I don't look that old ), I'm really not very good! Having played in many different bands across multiple genres, I settled into my comfort zone within a _niche_ area of **Alternative Rock**. Most recently playing with my band **Kid Luna** which you can listen to on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7wmbd6bV4rL3LxFCGEbskg?si=8bnlM0msQXG736rXvJaaNg) and watch our one and only music video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU9oEmRk1_g)!

## Hobbies

When I'm not staring at a screen, you'll likely find me jamming with friends or bandmates, reading a self-improvement book, travelling and visiting new places, researching and studying up on new financial investment opportunities or just chilling out and playing some games on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/544209764486479882). Add me and come say hi!
